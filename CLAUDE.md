## Project Overview

AI Story Forge (AI Story Creation Workshop) is a comprehensive English-language framework for AI-assisted creative writing. It provides structured templates, methodologies, and command tools for creating consistent characters and compelling narratives using generative AI.

**Key Features**:
- Motivation-driven character development system
- Three-phase story construction methodology  
- Five-axis quality evaluation framework
- Integrated Claude command system
- Workspace management for personal projects

## Core Methodologies

### 1. Motivation-First Character Development
Characters are built starting from their core motivation ("What does this person want?"), ensuring all actions and behaviors stem from this central drive.

### 2. Three-Layer Character System
- **Layer 1: Immutable Core**: Core motivation, values, fears, and contradictions
- **Layer 2: Semi-stable Layer**: Emotional patterns, relationships, growth direction
- **Layer 3: Variable Layer**: Speech patterns, behaviors, mannerisms

### 3. Three-Phase Story Construction
- **Phase 1**: Skeleton (basic plot structure)
- **Phase 2**: Key scenes identification
- **Phase 3**: Detailed scene design

### 4. Five-Axis Quality Evaluation
Each scene/story is evaluated on:
1. Character consistency
2. Physical logic
3. Psychological naturalness
4. Readability
5. Emotional impact

## Working with This Repository

### For Template Development
- Maintain English language throughout
- Follow established naming conventions
- Keep examples in designated directories
- Ensure consistency with core methodologies

### For Creative Writing
1. Copy templates to personal workspace:
   ```bash
   cp character-template/CHARACTER.md my-characters/[name].character.md
   cp story-template/STORY.md my-stories/[title]/story.md
   ```

2. Use Claude commands (v1.0.25+ with argument support):
   - `/character new` - Create new character
   - `/character develop [name]` - Develop existing character
   - `/story plot "[title]"` - Start new story with title
   - `/scene dialogue [character] [mood]` - Create dialogue scene
   - `/quality scene "[name]" --detail` - Detailed quality evaluation

3. Personal work is automatically gitignored:
   - `my-characters/*` (except README.md)
   - `my-stories/*` (except README.md)
   - `*.character.md`, `*.story.md`, `*.scene.md`

## Command System Integration

The `.claude/commands/` directory contains five specialized commands (compatible with Claude Code v1.0.25+) that guide users through:
- Character creation with motivation focus (`/character [action] [name]`)
- Story construction with phased approach (`/story [type] [title]`)
- Scene crafting with sensory details (`/scene [type] [character] [mood]`)
- Natural dialogue writing (`/dialogue [type] [characters]`)
- Quality evaluation and improvement (`/quality [target] [options]`)

Each command now supports:
- **Argument handling**: Commands accept `$ARGUMENTS` for flexible usage
- **Clear usage instructions** in English
- **Multiple options and parameters**
- **Practical examples with argument patterns**
- **Integration with project templates**

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding Features
1. Consider how it supports the core methodologies
2. Provide both template and command support
3. Include practical examples
4. Update relevant documentation
5. Maintain backward compatibility

### Quality Standards
- All documentation must be clear and actionable
- Examples should demonstrate best practices
- Commands should guide users step-by-step
- Templates must be flexible yet structured

## Version History
- v0.0.1: Initial release with core templates and commands
- v0.0.2: Added workspace management and .gitignore configuration
- v0.0.3: Enhanced Claude Code command support with $ARGUMENTS handling

## Key Principles
1. **Motivation drives everything** - All character actions stem from core desires
2. **Structure enables creativity** - Templates provide framework, not restrictions
3. **Quality through iteration** - Use evaluation tools to improve continuously
4. **Privacy by default** - Personal creations are never tracked by git

Remember: This repository empowers writers to collaborate effectively with AI while maintaining the human touch that makes stories compelling.
